# Test Utilities for SDK for Rust code examples

## Purpose

These utilities help streamline common testing actions in the AWS SDK for Rust.

## Code example

- [Macros for creating mock connection request/response pairs](src/macros.rs)

## âš  Important

- We recommend that you grant this code least privilege,
  or at most the minimum permissions required to perform the task.
  For more information, see
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
  in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions.
  Some AWS services are available only in specific
  [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code example

The code in this example is not self-executing. Instead, look at its usage in
the unit tests of other AWS SDK for Rust examples.

## Contributing

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team,
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls.
